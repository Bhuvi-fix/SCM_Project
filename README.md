## Description
A smart attendance tracking system

Key Features
Attendance Tracker: Students can manually enter attendance or sync with college portals (if possible).
Safe Bunk Calculator: Automatically calculates how many classes a student can afford to miss without falling below the required percentage.
Reminder Alerts: Sends notifications when attendance is at risk and suggests attending upcoming classes.
Class Schedule Management: Allows students to enter and manage their timetable.

The idea is simply an attendance tracking system. But with a twist it gives count of classes you can bunk to maintain your attendance and how many classes you need to attend if you have below 75%(attendance criteria).
